            <div class="post-content">
                <p>My name is Shiloh Williams and I use they/she pronouns. I am the Product Lead for Data Management Planning at the Digital Research Alliance of Canada, where I lead strategy and development for the DMP Assistant. Before joining the Alliance, I was the GIS and Data Services Librarian at Brock University, where I also served as the Acting Head of the Digital Scholarship Lab and the Map, Data &amp; GIS Library. Prior to that, I was the Data Visualization and GIS Librarian at the University of Texas at Arlington.</p>
<p>I have also worked at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) (at the Digital Library Program, Arts Library, and Institute for Research on Labor and Employment) and the Center for the Study of Political Graphics, where I analyzed and visualized collections data. I also hold a Masters degree in Library and Information Science from UCLA, where I studied the technical and theoretical aspects of data science. For a brief stint, I wrangled data for <a href="https://www.cinefilevideo.com/">CineFile Video</a> in exchange for free movie rentals.</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, my research interests are in data science, design, knowledge production, and feminist epistemology. Lately I&rsquo;ve been interested in why some research methodologies are seen as more rigorous than others, and how that relates to systems of domination. My current research project draws upon the work of artists (such as Martha Rosler), scholars of autobiography (including Nancy K. Miller, Sidonie Smith, and Julia Watson), and critical code and data studies researchers to explore the differences between valuation and review of computational and craft-based forms of research and creation.</p>
<p>Outside of work, I enjoy visiting museums and galleries; reading books; listening to music in big headphones; experimenting with analog photography (usually with a Minolta X-700, Olympus Mju II, or Holga 120N); cooking and baking with a stand mixer I got off Kijiji; playing JRPGs like Final Fantasy and Shin Megami Tensei; and, when it&rsquo;s warm enough, going on walks and exploring Toronto&rsquo;s public transit system.</p>
