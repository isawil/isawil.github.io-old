      <description>My name is Shiloh Williams and I use they/them pronouns. I currently work as the Acting Head of the Digital Scholarship Lab and the Map, Data &amp;amp; GIS Library at Brock University, where I provide instructional and research support for data and GIS on campus. Prior to that, I was the Data Visualization and GIS Librarian at the University of Texas at Arlington.
I have also worked at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and the Center for the Study of Political Graphics, where I analyzed and visualized collections data.</description>
