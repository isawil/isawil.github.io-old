      <description>My name is Shiloh Williams and I use they/she pronouns. I&amp;rsquo;m the GIS and Data Services Librarian at Brock University, where I also served as the Acting Head of the Digital Scholarship Lab and the Map, Data &amp;amp; GIS Library. Prior to that, I was the Data Visualization and GIS Librarian at the University of Texas at Arlington.
I have also worked at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) (at the Digital Library Program, Arts Library, and Institute for Research on Labor and Employment) and the Center for the Study of Political Graphics, where I analyzed and visualized collections data.</description>

      <description>While working at academic institutions I have had the opportunity to work on various data science projects, including the following, some of which is discussed in my blog.
COVID-19 dashboard In collaboration with Peace Ossom Williamson, I created a Tableau dashboard that reported COVID-19 case counts in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex. The insights gained from the process informed an analysis of public health data availability that I co-authored and which was peer-reviewed and published in JMIR Public Health and Surveillance.</description>
