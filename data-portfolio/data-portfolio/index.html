<h2 id="covid-19-dashboard">COVID-19 dashboard</h2>
<p><img src="/static/covid-dash-01.png" alt="Dashboard of COVID-19 spread in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex"></p>
<p>In collaboration with Peace Ossom Williamson, I created a Tableau dashboard that reported COVID-19 case counts in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex. The insights gained from the process informed an analysis of public health data availability that I co-authored and which was peer-reviewed and published in JMIR Public Health and Surveillance.</p>
<h2 id="texas-ufo-sightings-visualization">Texas UFO Sightings visualization</h2>
<p><img src="/static/texasmap.jpg" alt="A map of UFO sightings in the American state of Texas"></p>
<p>To explore Datawrapper, I used a dataset of UFO sightings that I obtained via Kaggle. After wrangling the data (creating a subset of Texas sightings, standardizing place names, adjusting geometry, making minor copyedits) in Microsoft Excel and OpenRefine, I uploaded the dataset to Datawrapper and created an interactive map. While browsing, users can learn more about UFO sightings that have been reported in Texas, including where they are most likely to happen (spoiler: like many geospatial analyses, it ends up being a population density map.)</p>
<h2 id="teaching-and-speaking">Teaching and speaking</h2>
<ul>
<li>I am certified to teach data science skills through Data Carpentry.</li>
<li>I have spoken on data science in various forums, including Statistics Canada, the Digital Library Forum, Canadian Association on Gerontology, Midwest Data Librarians Symposium, and more.</li>
<li>I am scheduled to teach a data science webinar for the Medical Library Association in 2022.</li>
<li>I have taught workshops on data management, data privacy, data visualization, and data analysis in academic settings.</li>
